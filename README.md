# RandomQuoteGenerator
 Treehouse Unit 1 Project
 
This is my first Javascript project with Treehouse, The RandomQuoteGenerator, Unit 1.

DESCRIPTION

When you open the web page it will display a random quote. If you click on the button then a new quote will appear.

MOTIVATION

This is my first ever Javascript project.  I have been inspired to not only build this as part of the Treehouse Techdegree course but to build on the skills and knowledge I have obtained to allow me to succeed and complete the course.

CODE USED

Javascript
